# Snake game

This is probably one of the most famous mobile games there ever was, snake!


## Project description
This is a snake game that has a moving snake, that you can control using the arrow keys on your keyboard.
You can go and get food, and then it grows in length as it eats more food.
You have to make sure you don't get tangled or hit the wall of the program, because then it's game over.
At the top of the screen there's a scoreboard that tracks how many pieces of food you've eaten.
